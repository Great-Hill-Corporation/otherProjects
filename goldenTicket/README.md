# goldenTicket

This is a somewhat weird idea out of left field. I know I will never implement it, so I give it to the world for free.

I was watching a movie the other day called "Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."

Here's the idea: create five golden Ethereum tickets and then contact a chocolate factory somewhere in the world. Get them to put the tickets (i.e. something like the Ethereum gift cards but printed on gold paper like in the book and loaded with some large amount of Ether—say $5,000 US equivalent). Hide the tickets inside the wrappers of five chocolate bars.

This would, I think, initiate great interest in Ethereum and might be the on-ramping we are all waiting for. It might become one of those weird world-wide obsessions where everyone hears about the idea in a short period of time.

One likely starting point on how to accomplish this might be similar to what they’ve done here: https://ether.cards.

Thoughts?


I was also thinking that the 'whales' should fund the project. There should be some sort of 'Charity DAO' or something that accepts ether and puts it to use in paying the winning tickets.

I was thinking further that this should be presented to the Ethereum Foundation as grant proposal to support the marketing effort.

I was also thinking that whatever chocolate company decides to participate would be instantly recognized as a thought leader.

I was further thinking something like this would grab headlines in a much wider world then that of just technology news blogs and financial news blogs and websites. We need to spread out into the real world.

I was thinking of the problem of the factory workers. There's a poker site called Vitue Poker where they use something called 'mental poker' to have each of the players at the table 'shuffle' and then sign the shuffled deck and then hand it to the next person who shuffles and signs it, and then it goes around again and each participant unencrypted the deck. (Or something like that--I don't know the details). In this way you only have to trust yourself that you shuffled properly. Something like this could be done with the winning tickets so the factory workers (or anyone who handles the chocolate bars are any stage) wouldn't know which tickets were the winners.
